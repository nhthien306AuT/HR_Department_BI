# HR_Department_BI

## 📌 Project Overview
  - The goal of this project is to analyze personal medical cost data to identify key factors that influence individual healthcare expenses.
  - Build a predictive model to estimate medical costs.
    
## 📁 Project Structure
  - Folders:
    + dataset: Raw data used for analysis and modeling.
    + report: Final analytical report with insights & recommendations, full data science modeling report: model building, evaluation, and performance analysis.
    + result: Exploratory analysis, visuals (boxplots, scatterplots, histogram), assumption results.
    + scripts: Python scripts for data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering & modeling.
      
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
  - Excel.
  - Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
    
## 🔄 Workflow
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering (Log Transformation, Interaction)
  - Model training and evaluation (Linear Regression)
  - Extracting insights to support decision-making
    
## 🎯 Results
  - The analysis shows that smoking status is the strongest driver of medical costs.
  - Age and BMI also contribute to higher charges, while gender and region have relatively minor effects.
  - Applying a log transformation on the target variable helped handle skewness and improved the robustness of the model.
