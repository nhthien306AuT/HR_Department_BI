# HR_Department_BI

## 📌 Project Overview
  - This project represents a digital transformation scenario for HR operations in an organization that previously relied on manual Excel-based workflows for workforce management and reporting. The goal is to demonstrate how transitioning from spreadsheet-driven processes to a centralized Power BI–driven Business Intelligence platform enables more effective, data-driven decision-making.
  - The solution consolidates HR data into interactive dashboards that support insights across recruitment, employee performance, compensation, retention, and workforce risk, replacing static Excel reports with dynamic analytics. The project highlights how BI adoption helps HR teams move beyond operational reporting toward strategic workforce performance optimization.
    
## 📁 Project Structure
  - Folders: Dataset HR Analytics (4 files)
  - HR_BI_Presentation: PowerPoint presentation that provides detailed explanations of dashboard charts, metrics, and insights to help users understand the analysis and business implications.
  - HR_Dash_BI_pdf: The PDF version provides a static snapshot of the dashboard for demonstration, documentation, and portfolio purposes, enabling stakeholders to review insights without requiring Power BI access.
  - HR_Dash_BI_template: The Power BI template (.pbit) is designed for client handover, allowing organizations to reuse the dashboard structure, data model, and DAX logic with their own HR data while ensuring data privacy and compliance.
      
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
  - Excel, powerBI.
    
## 🧱 Dashboard Architecture
  - Overview dashboard: Executive-level overview consolidating key insights from recruitment, workforce, retention, and attrition for holistic decision-making.
  - Recruitment Dashboard: Analyzes hiring funnel, recruitment channels, quality of hire to evaluate, optimize recruitment performance,...
  - Attrition Dashboard: Monitors attrition trends, patterns, and drivers to understand employee turnover and workforce stability.
  - Workforce Detail Dashboard: Provides detailed employee-level insights across roles, tenure, compensation, performance, and demographics.
  - Retention Dashboard: Identifies high-risk employees, key attrition drivers, and targeted retention actions with estimated cost impact.

## 🧠 Scenario
  - The client engaged the consultant to support the digital transformation of HR reporting, transitioning from Excel-based workflows to a Power BI–driven analytics solution. The initial engagement was defined as a fixed-scope BI package, covering the design and delivery of 5 dashboards: **Overview, Recruitment, Workforce Detail, Retention, and Attrition**.
  - The agreed project fee for the BI package was **USD 5,000**, with a delivery timeline of **3–4 weeks**. The scope focused on delivering a functional BI framework and demo solution, including dashboard design, KPI definitions, a reusable Power BI template, and supporting documentation.
  - Upon delivery, the dashboards provided consolidated visibility across key HR domains. However, the solution was positioned as a demonstration and analytical foundation, rather than a fully production-optimized system. In particular, the Retention dashboard required further refinement through collaboration with HR subject-matter experts to validate attrition key drivers and recommended actions in the call-to-action table.
  - After client acceptance of the BI deliverables, the consultant recommended extending the engagement to achieve deeper optimization. 2 optional add-on services were proposed:
      + **Data Analytics (DA) extension – USD 3,000 – 5,000**:
      Focused on deeper pattern discovery, workforce segmentation, and the identification of recurring HR operational tasks for daily and weekly monitoring.
      + **Data Science (DS) extension – USD 5,000 – 7,000**:
      Focused on developing a more advanced attrition risk scoring and flagging system, enabling predictive insights and more accurate prioritization of retention actions.
  - The client was informed that the initial USD 5,000 BI package establishes the visibility and reporting foundation, while the DA and DS extensions represent the next phase toward a more optimized and production-ready HR decision system.
